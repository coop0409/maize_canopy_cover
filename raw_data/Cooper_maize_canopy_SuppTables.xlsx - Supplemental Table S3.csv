"Supplemental Table S2. Mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of percent canopy cover at 50 GDD intervals, rate of canopy development between 50 GDD intervals, and for each trait averaged across growth stages. Percent of variance explained (PVE) by factors influencing percent canopy cover at 50 GDD intervals, rate of canopy development between 50 GDD intervals, and PVE for each trait averaged across growth stages. Insignificant factors (p > .05) are asterisked. Mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the sum across environments of absolute value of GxE interaction (AVAMGE) modeled by an additive main-effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model for genotypes using percent canopy cover at 50 GDD intervals, rate of canopy development between 50 GDD intervals, and each trait averaged across growth stages. Mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of Finley-Wilkinson (FW) regression coefficients for genotypes using percent canopy cover at 50 GDD intervals, rate of canopy development between 50 GDD intervals, and each trait averaged across growth stages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
